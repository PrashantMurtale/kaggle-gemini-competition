# 🎯 TOMORROW'S ACTION PLAN - Kaggle Gemini Competition

**Date: December 11, 2025**  
**Deadline: December 12, 2025** (Tomorrow night!)

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT API QUOTA ISSUE

Your API key appears to have **0 quota** for most Gemini models. Here's what to check:

### Check Your API Key Status:
1. Visit: https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit
2. Check if you have free tier access enabled
3. Verify your daily/monthly limits

### Potential Solutions:
1. **Wait 24 hours** - Quotas reset daily (midnight Pacific Time)
2. **Get a new API key** - Delete old one, create fresh at https://aistudio.google.com/
3. **Check billing** - Ensure you're on the free tier at https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
4. **Use a different model** - Currently set to `gemini-2.5-flash` (best free tier)

2. **Test Both Apps**
   - Doc2App: Try with OpenWeatherMap API docs
   - CodeVision: Upload a UI screenshot and generate code
   - Make sure everything works smoothly

3. **Choose Your Project**
   - Pick ONE app to submit (I recommend CodeVision AI for "wow factor")

   - 0:20-0:40: Solution overview
   - 0:40-1:40: Live demo (THE WOW MOMENT!)
   - 1:40-2:00: Impact & Gemini features

7. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Create public repo
   - Add all files (except .env!)
   - Write beautiful README

## 💡 DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT

### Doc2App Generator (if you choose this):
"Developers waste hours reading API documentation and writing integration code. Doc2App uses Gemini 2.5's massive 1M token context to transform complete API docs into production-ready applications instantly. [DEMO] Just paste documentation, select your framework, and get working code with tests and error handling. This saves 2-3 hours per API integration."

### CodeVision AI (RECOMMENDED):
"Designers create beautiful mockups, but developers spend hours recreating them in code. CodeVision AI uses Gemini's multimodal capabilities to turn any screenshot into pixel-perfect code. [DEMO] Upload a UI image, select your framework, and watch as it generates production-ready code. This bridges the gap between design and development, making coding accessible to designers and saving developers hours daily."
